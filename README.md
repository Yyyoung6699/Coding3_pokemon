## IDE
I've been studying on a Jupyter notebook, but I find it inconvenient. I decided to use PyCharm to complete this assignment.

## INSPIRATION
After seeing this project Anime-WGAN-GP(https://github.com/luzhixing12345/Anime-WGA), I hope to do a similar project to generate animation pictures. I want to train a model of my own. So the early stage of my project followed the instructions in this tutorial.

## DATASET
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset

I am a big Pokemon fan, I love this dataset, I want to use this dataset to train models and generate Pokemon ons.

## What I did in this Project
### 1.Download and Test
I downloaded the Anime-WGAN-GP (https://github.com/luzhixing12345/Anime-WGA). And a set of pictures were generated with the Pretrained model_WGAN_ANIME256 provided by it, which was very successful.
### 2.Train
